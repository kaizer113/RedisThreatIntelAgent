# Value Wholesale pickup-rescue demo flow

This is an alternative 8–10 minute presenter path for the Value Wholesale shopping agent. It
follows one customer story: Alex has an order waiting in Portland, discovers that a preferred
laundry item is unavailable there, finds it at another warehouse, and adds the grounded result to
the cart. Along the way, the trace exposes governed commerce access, semantic caching, two memory
systems, session continuity, model switching, and an out-of-domain guardrail.

Use this path when the audience will respond better to a continuous shopping journey than to the
feature-by-feature flow in [demo.md](demo.md).

## Before the session

1. Start the application, open its URL, scroll to **Presenter controls**, and click **Reset demo
   cache**. If a prior run changed Alex's preferences, also click **Reset member memory** to
   restore his Redis and ADK long-term memories from the seed data. Confirm each reset and wait for
   the ready message. This control is available only for the four small demo members.
2. Return to the top, confirm the services are configured, and check **Context Retriever** in the
   Redis service panel. It starts unchecked even though its client and governed tool catalog are
   warmed in the background.
3. Select **Alex Rivera** in **Shop as** and **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** in **Model**.
4. Wait for the greeting to finish before sending the first prompt.

Alex is the fictional member `member-1001`. The deterministic dataset gives Alex a Portland home
warehouse, a ready-for-pickup order, a fragrance-free household preference, and a preference for
Portland pickup. Portland has no Clear Tide Laundry Pods in stock; Seattle has 24.

Changing the selected member creates a new session and clears the visible conversation. Keep Alex
selected throughout this flow so later turns can demonstrate short-term context and cart state.

## 1. Begin with the member's active order

Prompt:

> Give me an account overview and tell me if I have anything to pick up.

Expected behavior:

- Vale identifies Alex as a Harbor Plus member with an `$86.42` reward balance.
- It leads with order `VH-ORD-1048`, ready for pickup at Portland Harbor.
- It may briefly mention delivered order `VH-ORD-1026`.

Expand the Context Retriever rows. The authoritative member profile was hydrated when Alex was
selected, while the current order state comes from a governed order lookup. The agent should not
pretend that identity data alone is a complete account view.

## 2. Inspect the pickup without repeating the account lookup

Prompt:

> What is in the order that is ready for pickup?

Expected contents of `VH-ORD-1048`:

- North Trail Organic Oats, 10 lb — `$15.99`.
- Family Dock Paper Towels, 12 rolls — `$23.99`.
- Rain City Medium Roast Coffee, 3 lb — `$25.49`.

Point out the order-item lookup in the trace. The previous turn established which order is active;
this turn drills into that single order instead of fetching unrelated order lines.

## 3. Answer and cache the pickup policy

First prompt:

> How long will Value Wholesale hold a pickup order after it is ready?

Expected grounded answer: pickup orders are held for three calendar days after the ready
notification. The named member must show photo identification at the pickup desk.

The trace should show a Semantic Router allow/cache decision, a LangCache miss, policy retrieval,
and `ADK Runner + Gemini`.

Then ask:

> How many days do I have to collect an order once pickup is ready?

The paraphrase should hit the versioned `policy:v1` LangCache scope and skip generation. Expand the
Semantic Router and LangCache rows to show the current query, cached query, semantic match, and
`ADK Runner + Gemini (0 llm calls)`.

## 4. Ask for a personalized gap-fill

Prompt:

> Using my preferences and recent purchases, what laundry option should I add to this pickup, and
> is it in stock in Portland?

Expected behavior:

- Redis Agent Memory supplies Alex's preference for fragrance-free household and laundry
  products.
- The recent-order context shows that Alex previously purchased Clear Tide Laundry Pods.
- Catalog search validates Clear Tide Laundry Pods, 152 count, at the member price of `$31.99`.
- The governed Portland inventory lookup reports quantity `0`.
- Vale does not add anything to the cart because the request asked for a recommendation, not a
  cart mutation.

Expand the long-term-memory rows to review the returned facts and retrieval latency.

## 5. Recover with live stock at another warehouse

Prompt:

> Check whether those Clear Tide pods are available in Seattle instead.

Expected answer: Seattle has `24` units of Clear Tide Laundry Pods. The trace should show a
governed lookup for inventory ID `seattle-vh-2002`.

Contrast this with Portland's quantity of `0`. The product is unchanged, but warehouse-specific
inventory is treated as live data and retrieved again rather than inferred from conversation
memory.

## 6. Make the cart mutation explicit

Prompt:

> Add one Clear Tide Laundry Pods to my cart.

Expected behavior: the `add_item_to_cart` tool records one unit of SKU `VH-2002` for Alex. Vale may
confirm the cart update, but it must not claim that checkout, payment, or an order placement
occurred.

Follow with:

> Show me my cart.

Expected behavior: `view_cart` returns one Clear Tide Laundry Pods entry. Point out that a read-only
recommendation, a cart mutation, and an order submission are separate actions with different
authorization boundaries.

## 7. Switch models without losing the journey

Keep the same conversation, switch **Model** to **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, and ask:

> Summarize my pickup plan, the stock issue we found, and what is in my cart.

The generation trace should name `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`. The shopping journey and current cart
remain available when the model changes.

## 8. Finish with the domain guardrail

Prompt:

> Where is Dagestan?

Expected behavior: the RedisVL Semantic Router blocks the out-of-domain request before LangCache,
memory retrieval, governed commerce tools, or Gemini run. Expand the trace to show the block and
the skipped downstream stages.

## Close

Recap the customer outcome and its evidence:

- Context Retriever separated authoritative profile, order, order-item, and live inventory reads.
- Redis session memory carried the multi-turn journey forward.
- Agent memory personalized the recommendation.
- LangCache reused a safe, grounded policy answer but bypassed personalized and volatile turns.
- The cart changed only after an explicit instruction.
- The model could change without losing session state.
- The Semantic Router stopped an out-of-domain request before downstream work.

The closing message is that Vale did more than produce fluent shopping advice: it exposed the
source, freshness, authorization boundary, and latency of each decision in the journey.

## Reliable fallback prompt

If the live shopping path is interrupted, use:

> How long will Value Wholesale hold a pickup order after it is ready?

It is deterministic, non-personalized, and exercises policy grounding plus the semantic-cache
path.
