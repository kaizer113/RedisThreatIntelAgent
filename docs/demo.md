# Value Wholesale recommended demo flow

This is an 8–10 minute presenter flow for the Value Wholesale shopping agent. It starts with a
customer need, reveals the live agent trace as evidence, and finishes with the two independent
memory paths and Gemini model selector.

## Before the session

1. Start the application, open its URL, scroll to **Presenter controls**, and click **Reset demo
   cache**. If a prior run changed Alex's preferences, also click **Reset member memory** to
   restore his Redis and ADK long-term memories from the seed data. Confirm each reset and wait for
   the ready message. This control is available only for the four small demo members.
2. Scroll back to the top of the page.
3. Confirm the services are configured, then check **Context Retriever** in the Redis service
   panel. It starts unchecked for before/after comparisons even though its client is already warm.
4. Select **Alex Rivera** in the **Shop as** dropdown.
5. Leave **Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite** selected.

The demo uses the fictional member `member-1001`, Alex Rivera, whose home warehouse is the
Portland Harbor location.

Wait for the member greeting to finish before starting the scripted prompts. Changing the selected
member clears the visible chat and starts a new session.

## 1. Grounded product discovery and live inventory

Prompt:

> Find family-size pantry staples under $30 and check Portland stock.

Expected answer:

- North Trail Organic Oats, 10 lb — member price `$15.99`, Portland quantity `31`.
- Harbor Select Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 2 x 1L — member price `$21.99`, Portland quantity `42`.

Point to the live trace while the request runs. It should show:

1. RedisVL Semantic Router allow/cache decision.
2. LangCache eligibility.
3. Redis short-term session retrieval.
4. Redis long-term memory retrieval.
5. ADK VertexAISession read and ADK Memory Bank search.
6. RedisVL catalog search.
7. Two governed `get_inventory_by_id` calls, each with its own latency.
8. `ADK Runner + Gemini`, its LLM call count, and its runner latency.

## 2. Show operational context and order history

Prompt:

> What do you know about me?

Expected result: the agent combines Alex's membership profile with live order context. It should
lead with order `VH-ORD-1048`, which is ready for pickup at Portland, and may briefly mention the
recent delivered order `VH-ORD-1026`. The trace should expose the Context Retriever order lookup
rather than stopping after the preloaded profile or using a hidden database call.

## 3. Demonstrate semantic response caching

LangCache uses three versioned semantic scopes in the same managed cache: `policy:v1`,
`product-education:catalog-v1`, and `shopping-guide:v1`. The scope is prefixed inside the prompt
to keep semantically similar questions from different workloads distinct without relying on
undeclared preview attributes.

### Policy scope

First prompt:

> What is the electronics return policy?

Expected grounded answer: electronics have a 90-day return window. The first request should show
a LangCache miss and normal policy retrieval/generation.

Then ask:

> How long is the return window for electronics ?

The second request should show a semantic LangCache hit and skip `ADK Runner + Gemini`. Explain
that the RedisVL Semantic Router allows reusable ecommerce answers into LangCache while
personalized and live-data requests bypass it. Out-of-domain requests are blocked before cache,
memory, or model execution. A hit also skips the Redis and ADK short- and long-term memory rows
because that context would not be used. Expand the LangCache hit to compare the current query with
the cached query that matched it.

### Product-education scope

First prompt:

> What flavor notes does Rain City Medium Roast Coffee have?

Then ask in a new session or after clearing the trace:

> How would you describe the taste of your whole-bean medium roast?

The first request generates a stable, catalog-grounded description. The paraphrase should hit
the `product-education:catalog-v1` scope. Cached product education excludes price, availability,
orders, member preferences, and other volatile or personalized fields.

### Shopping-guide scope

First prompt:

> How should I store a large bag of rolled oats after opening?

Then ask:

> What is the best way to keep bulk oats fresh?

The paraphrase should hit `shopping-guide:v1`. This demonstrates reusable guidance rather than
only policy FAQs. Guides remain generic and cannot contain member or live-commerce data.

For every cacheable example, expand the Semantic Router and LangCache trace rows. Point out the
versioned scope, the first miss, the semantic hit, the current-versus-cached query comparison, and
`ADK Runner + Gemini (0 llm calls)` on the hit.

## 4. Show both memory systems on every request

Prompt:

> What household products and pickup options do I prefer?

Expected memories:

- Alex prefers fragrance-free household and laundry products.
- Alex prefers warehouse pickup at the Portland Harbor location.

Expand the memory steps in the trace to review the returned facts and retrieval latency.

## 5. Save and recall a new preference

Prompt:

> Remember that I prefer fragrance-free household products and Portland pickup.

The trace should show the explicit Redis Agent Memory write. ADK queues the completed session for
Memory Bank generation after the turn. Redis promotion and Memory Bank generation are eventually
consistent, so do not promise that newly generated long-term facts appear synchronously.

Follow with:

> Based on what you remember, what laundry option should I consider and can I pick it up in Portland?

Expected behavior: the agent recalls the preference, finds Clear Tide Laundry Pods, and reports
that Portland inventory is `0`. This is a useful proof that personalization does not override live
stock truth.

## 6. Switch models without losing the session

Keep the same conversation, change the composer dropdown to **Gemini 3.1 Pro**, and ask:

> Plan the best pantry purchase under $40 using my preferences and explain the trade-off.

Point out that the generation trace names `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` and that the session remains
available when the model changes.

## 7. Close on transparency

Summarize the trace from top to bottom:

- RedisVL Semantic Router allow/block and cache decision;
- short-term context;
- Redis long-term memories and facts;
- ADK Memory Bank memories and facts;
- governed MCP and commerce tool calls;
- selected Gemini model;
- `ADK Runner + Gemini` and total latency.

The key message is that Value Wholesale does not merely produce an answer: it exposes where context
came from, which actions ran, which memory system returned each fact, and how long each step took.

## Reliable fallback prompt

If a live product flow is interrupted, use:

> What is the electronics return policy?

It is non-personalized, deterministic, and exercises the policy grounding plus LangCache path.
